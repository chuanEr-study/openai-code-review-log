This code diff shows changes to GitHub Actions workflows for a project. Below is a review of the changes:

### `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml`

**Changes:**
- The workflow trigger has been updated from `main` to `main-close`.
- The `push` and `pull_request` branches have been updated to trigger on `main-close` instead of `main`.

**Analysis:**
- The change from `main` to `main-close` for the workflow triggers might indicate that the workflow should only run on commits to the `main-close` branch. This could be a branching strategy where `main-close` is a protected branch that only contains code ready for release.
- The lack of explanation for the change in branch names could be confusing for other contributors or maintainers who might not be aware of the branching strategy.

**Recommendations:**
- Add a comment or documentation in the workflow file explaining the change from `main` to `main-close`. This will help maintainers understand the intention behind the change.
- Ensure that the workflow's name or description reflects the current configuration to avoid confusion.

### `.github/workflows/main-remote-jar.yml`

**Changes:**
- The workflow trigger has been updated from `main-close` to `main`.
- The `push` and `pull_request` branches have been updated to trigger on `main` instead of `main-close`.

**Analysis:**
- The change from `main-close` to `main` for the workflow triggers seems to be the opposite of the change in the `main-maven-jar.yml` workflow. This could indicate a mistake or an intended reversal of the strategy.
- The lack of explanation for the change in branch names is similar to the previous workflow.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure that the changes in the `main-remote-jar.yml` workflow are consistent with the intended workflow strategy. If it's intentional, document the reasoning.
- If there was a mistake, correct the workflow to match the intended strategy and document the correction.
- Update the workflow's name or description to reflect the current configuration.

### General Recommendations:
- Always document changes, especially when they affect workflow triggers and branch configurations. This helps future contributors and maintainers understand the project's workflow and branching strategy.
- Review the entire workflow file to ensure that all jobs and steps are still relevant and correctly configured.
